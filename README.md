# buf-setup-action

Install and setup [buf](https://github.com/bufbuild/buf) for use in other actions.

## Usage

Refer to the [action.yml](https://github.com/bufbuild/buf-setup-action/blob/main/action.yml)
to see all of the action parameters.

If `version` is unspecified, the default value is set to the latest `buf` version:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v2
  - uses: bufbuild/buf-setup-action@v0.6.0
  - run: buf --version
```

If you want to pin to a specific version, vou can explicitly set it like so:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v2
  - uses: bufbuild/buf-setup-action@v0.6.0
    with:
      version: '1.0.0-rc1'
  - run: buf --version
```

If you'd like to resolve the latest release from GitHub, you can specify `latest`,
but this is **not** recommended:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v2
  - uses: bufbuild/buf-setup-action@v0.6.0
    with:
      version: 'latest'
  - run: buf --version
```

Optionally, you can supply a `github_token` input so that any GitHub API
requests are authenticated, avoiding any potential rate limit issues when
running on GitHub hosted runners:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: bufbuild/buf-setup-action@v0.6.0
    with:
      github_token: ${{ github.token }}
      version: 'latest'
```

After `buf-setup`, the `buf` command will be in `$PATH` and you are ready to use one 
of the other Buf actions such as [buf-breaking][1], [buf-lint][2], and [buf-push][3]. 
You can also use the `buf` command directly from a workflow step. 

When calling the `buf` command directly from a workflow step, you may need to authenticate with 
Buf Schema Registry. You can authenticate by setting the `BUF_TOKEN` environment variable. 
For example, if you have a GitHub secret called `BUF_TOKEN` you can set the `BUF_TOKEN` 
environment variable with this yaml:

```yaml
env:
  BUF_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.BUF_TOKEN }}
```

## Installing `protoc`

In most cases, you _don't_ need to install [`protoc`][4] for Buf's GitHub Actions, but
some `protoc` plugins are built-in to the compiler itself. If you need to execute any of
`protoc-gen-{cpp,csharp,java,js,objc,php,python,ruby,kotlin}`, then you'll need to install
`protoc` alongside `buf`. In these cases, `buf` actually executes `protoc` as a plugin,
but continues to use its own [internal compiler][5].

The `buf-setup-action` won't install `protoc` for you, but there are other options you can
use, such as [setup-protoc][6]. For clarity, you can configure it alongside `buf` like so:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v2
  - uses: bufbuild/buf-setup-action@v0.6.0
  - uses: arduino/setup-protoc@v1
```
